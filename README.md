# DeskFX

Framework to build professional multiplatform JavaFX applications targeted to the desktop.

Professionals like business stakeholders, engineers, scientist and mathemematicians primarily use the desktop computing to fulfil their work requirements. DeskFX provides first-class support for professional desktop applications and, also the possibility to run the same applications on mobile, web and IoT since it is based on JavaFX.

## Use Cases

This framework is targeted for engineers developing professional long-term projects and not for general-purpose GUI applications. Some of the best use cases for using DeskFX are:

- Engineering-scale professional desktop applications (probably declarative).
- Crossplatform 2D graphics support with [Gencesk 2D](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/gencesk-2d).
- Scientific/ML applications.
- Educational applications.
- Student systems.
- Enterprise applications (ERP, CRM, etc.).
- Offline support.
- Higher performance.
- Most of Java/JavaFX use cases.

Most of these use cases are achieved thanks to the Java and JavaFX stable ecosystem where applications have minimum maintainance costs (see [Java for the cloud, and the cloud for Java](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/java-cloud-services)) and the expected JavaFX app minimum lifetime is about 10 years whilst general purpose platforms like web or mobile frameworks require volatile build operations and API breaking changens so that each year you need to fix them before getting obsolete.

If bussiness logic is the priority all other options are not viable since most front-ends are volatiles and general-purpose. This is because the business logic doesn't change much but the underlying technologies do. This leads to unnecesary maintainance costs as you probably don't need all the benefits of mobile devices and front-end capabilities.

For instance, I care more about data and model visualization than knowing the version of Android the app is running since all professionals work with the desktop (IDE, Photoshop, ERP, CAD, etc.) but I still have the availability to allow users to run the same app on their phone or web browser which is also required for some users.
